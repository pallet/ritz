  "Provides Java classpath and (compiled) Clojure namespace browsing.
  Scans the classpath for all class files, and provides functions for
  categorizing them. Classes are resolved on the start-up classpath only.
  Calls to 'add-classpath', etc are not considered.

  Class information is built as a list of maps of the following keys:
    :name  Java class or Clojure namespace name
    :loc   Classpath entry (directory or jar) on which the class is located
    :file  Path of the class file, relative to :loc"
  (:import [java.io File FilenameFilter]
           [java.util StringTokenizer]
           [java.util.jar JarFile JarEntry]
           [java.util.regex Pattern])
  (:require [dynapath.core :as dp]))
